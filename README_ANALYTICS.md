# posthoganalytics

> **Do not use this package.** Use [`posthog`](https://pypi.org/project/posthog/) instead.

```bash
pip install posthog
```

This package exists solely for internal use by [posthog/posthog](https://github.com/posthog/posthog) to avoid import conflicts with the local `posthog` package in that repository. It is an automatically generated mirror of `posthog` — same code, same versions, just published under a different name.

If you are not working on the PostHog main repository, you should never need this package. All documentation, issues, and development happen in [`posthog-python`](https://github.com/posthog/posthog-python).
