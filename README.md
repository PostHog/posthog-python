# Local Development

## Testing Locally

1. Run `python3 -m venv env` (creates virtual environment called "env")
2. Run `source env/bin/activate` (activates the virtual environment)
3. Run `python3 -m pip install -e ".[test]"` (installs the package in develop mode, along with test dependencies)
4. Run `make test`

## Running Locally

Assuming you have a [local version of PostHog](https://posthog.com/docs/developing-locally) running, you can run `python3 example.py` to see the library in action.
